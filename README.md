# Frankenstein Finetune (Hybrid CPU→GPU)

Finetune a language model to write **original Frankenstein-style fanfiction**.

- **CPU phase (local/IDE):** EDA, dataset curation, tokenizer checks, evaluation harness.
- **GPU phase (Colab/Kaggle/RunPod):** QLoRA on **Mistral-7B**. Optional fallback: full finetune **DistilGPT-2** on CPU.

This project is structured for learning: notebooks are 70% explanation and 30% TODO cells. You write the code.

## Why hybrid?

Most of the work (data + evaluation) runs great on CPU. Only the QLoRA training needs a GPU. We use the **Hugging Face Hub** to shuttle datasets and adapters between environments.

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-cpu.txt
# Put your CSV at data/raw/frankenstein_chunks.csv (a column named 'text').
# Work notebooks in order: 00 → 04 (CPU). Then 10 → 11 (GPU).
```

### GPU run (Colab/Kaggle)

1. Open `notebooks/10_train_qlora_mistral7b_colab.ipynb` in Colab.
2. Runtime → GPU (T4).
3. Follow cells to install deps, pull dataset from Hub, train LoRA adapters, and push them back.

### Fallback: DistilGPT-2 on CPU

If you cannot use a GPU, use `notebooks/20_distilgpt2_cpu_finetune_optional.ipynb`. Slower but meets rubric.

## Deliverables

- ✅ **Reproducible dataset on HF Hub:** [`Tuminha/frankenstein-fanfic-snippets`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tuminha/frankenstein-fanfic-snippets) (private)
  - 456 train samples, 25 validation samples (5% split)
  - Ready for GPU training in Colab
- ✅ **QLoRA adapters on HF Hub:** [`Tuminha/mistral-frankenstein-qlora`](https://huggingface.co/Tuminha/mistral-frankenstein-qlora)
- Model Card (`cards/MODEL_CARD_TEMPLATE.md` → paste to your Hub repo)
- Space card (`cards/SPACE_CARD_TEMPLATE.md`) if you deploy a demo

## Evaluation

- ✅ **Perplexity on validation:** Base 7.95 → Finetuned 7.95 (no improvement detected - see analysis)
- ⏳ **Qualitative samples:** Generation comparison implemented (ready to run)
- ✅ **Hyperparameters documented:** See training section and `configs/train.yaml`
- 📊 **Detailed analysis:** See `ANALYSIS_perplexity_results.md` for comprehensive findings

## Data

`frankenstein_chunks.csv` — short textual snippets (public domain). You are responsible for legal use of any extra data.

### Dataset Analysis

After EDA (notebook 01), we found:
- **481 text snippets** (after cleaning: removed duplicates, normalized quotes)
- **Token length distribution:** Right-skewed (slightly), approaching normal distribution

<div align="center">

<img src="images/length_distributions.png" alt="Token and Character Length Distributions" width="680" />

</div>

**What the right-skewed distribution means:**
- Most snippets are relatively short (left side of distribution)
- A smaller number of longer snippets create the right tail
- This is **beneficial for training** because:
  - Most samples fit comfortably within our 512-token limit
  - Fewer truncations needed → less information loss
  - Efficient batch packing during training
  - The slight skew indicates natural variation in snippet lengths (realistic for fanfiction)

**Implications for training:**
- ✅ Most samples will use the full context window effectively
- ✅ Minimal padding waste (most samples are similar length)
- ✅ Good balance between context and efficiency

### Baseline Evaluation Results

After running notebook 04, we established baseline metrics using both DistilGPT-2 (CPU proxy) and Mistral-7B (GPU baseline):

#### Perplexity Comparison

| Model | Perplexity | Samples | Tokens | Time | Device |
|-------|------------|---------|--------|------|--------|
| **DistilGPT-2** (CPU proxy) | **10.55** | 25 | 5,828 | ~5-15 min | CPU |
| **Mistral-7B** (real baseline) | **10.55** | 25 | 5,828 | **2 seconds** | GPU (A100) |

**Key Findings:**
- Both models show the same perplexity (10.55) on the validation set
- Mistral-7B on A100 GPU is **~150x faster** than DistilGPT-2 on CPU
- This baseline will be used to measure improvement after finetuning
- **Target:** Lower perplexity (<10.0) after QLoRA training indicates better model alignment

#### Generation Quality Comparison

**Mistral-7B (GPU) - High Quality Gothic Style:**
```
Prompt: "It was on a dreary night of November that"
Output: "I beheld the apparition. The rain fell in torrents, except when it was 
driven back by furious gusts of wind which swept over the deserted streets and 
through the leafless trees like ghostly processions. As the storm raged around me 
with an intensity such as I had never known before, I sat alone in my study, 
brooding over the dark secret which had been revealed to me but a few days previously."
```
✅ **Gothic atmosphere** (rain, wind, storm, darkness)  
✅ **Thematically consistent** (Frankenstein themes)  
✅ **Good narrative flow** (coherent storytelling)

**DistilGPT-2 (CPU) - Poor Quality:**
```
Prompt: "It was on a dreary night of November that"
Output: "I had been working with for about two years. 'I came to the conclusion, 
this is my first time doing so and it's all part 'em! We're still waiting here 
because our last three months have just gone by without any explanation.'"
```
❌ **Not Gothic style** (modern, casual language)  
❌ **Off-topic** (doesn't match Frankenstein themes)  
❌ **Poor coherence** (fragmented, unclear narrative)

**Conclusion:**
- Mistral-7B already produces high-quality Gothic/Frankenstein-style text
- Finetuning with QLoRA will improve consistency and alignment with our specific dataset
- The baseline is strong, so we expect incremental but meaningful improvements

### `notebooks/10_train_qlora_mistral7b_colab.ipynb` (GPU) ✅

**Markdown:** What QLoRA is, what 4-bit quantization does, why T4 fits, hyperparameters in plain English, how to avoid OOM.

**Code (Completed):**
- ✅ Installed GPU dependencies and verified CUDA availability (A100 GPU detected).
- ✅ Loaded dataset from HF Hub (`Tuminha/frankenstein-fanfic-snippets`) - raw text format for SFTTrainer.

- ✅ Created LoRA config (r=8, alpha=16, dropout=0.05) and TrainingArguments; completed 1 epoch of training.
- ✅ Pushed LoRA adapters to Hugging Face Hub.

**Training Details:**
- **Model:** Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 with QLoRA (4-bit quantization)
- **LoRA Configuration:** r=8, alpha=16, dropout=0.05, target_modules=['q_proj', 'k_proj', 'v_proj', 'o_proj']
- **Training:** 1 epoch, batch_size=1, gradient_accumulation_steps=16 (effective batch size=16)
- **Optimizer:** paged_adamw_8bit, learning_rate=2e-4, bf16 precision
- **Note:** Validation loss is logged to training logs (wandb disabled for compatibility)

### `notebooks/11_evaluate_and_generate_gpu.ipynb` (GPU) ✅

**Markdown:** Compare base vs finetuned: perplexity and qualitative generations; document results and caveats.

**Code (Completed):**
- ✅ Loaded base model + attached LoRA adapters; computed perplexity on validation slice.
- ✅ Implemented diagnostic code to verify adapters are loaded and active.
- ✅ Generated side-by-side comparisons with both models (implementation complete, ready to run).

**Evaluation Results:**

#### Perplexity Comparison (After QLoRA Training)

| Model | Perplexity | Samples | Time | Device |
|-------|------------|---------|------|--------|
| **Base Mistral-7B** | **7.95** | 25 | ~0.3 min | GPU (L4) |
| **Finetuned Mistral-7B** | **7.95** | 25 | ~0.3 min | GPU (L4) |
| **Improvement** | **0.00** | - | - | - |

**Key Findings:**
- ⚠️ **Identical perplexity scores** - No measurable improvement detected
- Training completed: 1 epoch, 29 steps (456 samples, effective batch size=16)
- Loss reduction: 2.23 → 2.07 (~7% reduction during training)
- **Possible explanations:**
  1. Adapters may not be fully active during evaluation (diagnostic code added to verify)
  2. Training duration may be insufficient (only 1 epoch)
  3. Small dataset (456 samples) with minimal loss reduction
  4. Base model already performs well on the task (perplexity 7.95 is quite low)

**Next Steps:**
- Run diagnostic code to verify adapters are active
- Compare qualitative generation outputs (style differences may exist even with identical perplexity)
- Consider training for more epochs (3-5) or increasing LoRA rank (r=16 or r=32)
- See `ANALYSIS_perplexity_results.md` for detailed analysis and recommendations

### `notebooks/20_distilgpt2_cpu_finetune_optional.ipynb` (CPU fallback)

**Markdown:** When to choose this path; expected speed; how it differs from QLoRA.

**Code (TODO):**
- Tokenize dataset with DistilGPT2; set reasonable seq_length for CPU.
- Configure TrainingArguments; train for 1-2 epochs on CPU.
